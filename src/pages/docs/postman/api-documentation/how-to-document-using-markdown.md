Postman contains a collection to test [Markdown styling](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/4630964/S1LsXVJy) inside Postman or in other services that render Markdown. The descriptions in the collection contain Markdown syntax and some of them have links to HTML pages of their rendered version.

Postman supports Markdown as a way to style text descriptions for requests, collections, and folders in collections. You can even embed screenshots and other images for more descriptive flair.
